DBIx::Poggy - async Pg with AnyEvent and Promises

    use DBIx::Poggy;
    my $pool = DBIx::Poggy->new( pool_size => 5 );
    $pool->connect('dbi:Pg:db=test', 'root', 'password');

    ->then(sub {

=head1 DESCRIPTION

"Async" postgres as much as L<DBD::Pg> allows with L<Promises> instead of callbacks.

You get DBI interface you used to that returns promises, connections pool, queries
queuing and support of transactions.

=head2 Why pool?

DBD::Pg is not async, it's non blocking. Every connection can execute only one query
at a moment, so to execute several queries in parallel you need several connections.
What you get is you can do something in Perl side while postgres crunches data for
you.

=head2 Queue

Usually if you attempt to run two queries on the same connection then DBI throws an
error about active query. Poggy takes care of that by queuing up queries you run on
one connection. Handy for transactions and pool doesn't grow too much.

=head2 What is async here then?

Only a queries on multiple connections, so if you need to execute many parallel
queries then you need many connections. pg_bouncer and haproxy are your friends.

=head1 METHODS

=head2 new

Named arguments:

=over 4

=item pool_size

number of connections to create, creates one more in case all are busy

=back

Returns a new pool object.

=cut

sub new {
    my $proto = shift;
    my $self = bless { @_ }, ref($proto) || $proto;
    return $self->init;
}

sub init {
    my $self = shift;
    $self->{pool_size} ||= 10;
    $self->{ping_on_take} ||= 30;
    return $self;
}

=head2 connect

Takes the same arguments as L<DBI/connect>, opens "pool_size" connections.

=cut

sub connect {
    my $self = shift;
    my ($dsn, $user, $password, $opts) = @_;

    $opts ||= {};

    $self->{free} ||= [];

    $self->{connection_settings} = [ $dsn, $user, $password, $opts ];

    $self->_connect for 1 .. $self->{pool_size};
    return $self;
}

sub _connect {
    my $self = shift;

    my $dbh = DBIx::Poggy::DBI->connect(
        @{ $self->{connection_settings} }
    ) or die DBIx::Poggy::Error->new( 'DBIx::Poggy::DBI' );
    push @{$self->{free}}, $dbh;
    $self->{last_used}{ refaddr $dbh } = time;

    return;
}

=head2 take

Gives one connection from the pool. Takes arguments:

=over 4

=item auto

Connection will be released to the pool after transaction or
as soon as query queue becomes empty. True by default.

=back

Returns L<DBIx::Poggy::DBI> handle. When "auto" is turned off
then in list context returns also guard object that will L</release>
handle to the pool on destruction.

=cut

sub take {
    my $self = shift;
    my (%args) = (auto => 1, @_);
    unless ( $self->{free} ) {
        die DBIx::Poggy::Error->new(
            err => 666,
            errstr => 'Attempt to take a connection from not initialized pool',
        );
    }
    my $dbh;
    while (1) {
        unless ( @{ $self->{free} } ) {
            warn "DB pool exhausted, creating a new connection";
            $self->_connect;
            $dbh = shift @{ $self->{free} };
            delete $self->{last_used}{ refaddr $dbh };
            last;
        }

        $dbh = shift @{ $self->{free} };
        my $used = delete $self->{last_used}{ refaddr $dbh };
        if ( ($used - time) > $self->{ping_on_take} ) {
            unless ( $dbh->ping ) {
                warn "connection is not alive, dropping";
                next;
            }
        }
        last;
    }

    if ( $args{auto} ) {
        $dbh->{private_poggy_state}{release_to} = $self;
        weaken $dbh->{private_poggy_state}{release_to};
        return $dbh;
    }
    return $dbh unless wantarray;
    return ( $dbh, guard { $self->release($dbh) } );
}

=head2 release

Takes a handle as argument and puts it back into the pool. At the moment,
no protection against double putting or active queries on the handle.

=cut

sub release {
    my $self = shift;
    my $dbh = shift;
    push @{ $self->{free} }, $dbh;
    $self->{last_used}{ refaddr $dbh } = time;
    return $self;
}
